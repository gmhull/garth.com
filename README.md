# garth.com

This is a django website that I made as a portfolio site. The project was inspired initially by Sentdex's youtube series on django web development. I was loking for a job at the time so I thought this project would be a good way to share my resume. The website is currently broken down into 3 sections, the main cover page, and about me section with resume, and a projects.

The website is stil lacking content at the moment. I plan to continue to add more to flush out the site. I want to use this to show off some of the projects that I have been working on. As I finish stuff I will add it on here.

Right now th domain for the site is garthdotcom.herokuapp.com. Enjoy!
